• Describe the general organization of a computer system and the role of
interrupts.


• Describe the components in a modern multiprocessor computer system.


• Illustrate the transition from user mode to kernel mode.


• Discuss how operating systems are used in various computing environments.




• Provide examples of free and open-source operating systems.



operating-system:  is software that manages a computer’s hardware. it acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware.

The hardware— the central processing unit (CPU), the memory, and the
input/output (I/O) devices—provides the basic computing resources for the
system.

 The application programs—such as word processors, spreadsheets,
compilers, and web browsers—define the ways in which these resources are
used to solve users’ computing problems.


ease of use/ operating system is designed mostly for
ease of use, with some attention paid to performance and security and none
paid to resource utilization

resource utilization/ is —how various hardware and software resources
are shared.


touch screen/ The user interface for mobile computers
generally features a touch screen, where the user interacts with the system by
pressing and swiping fingers across the screen rather than using a physical
keyboard and mouse.


voice recognition, like siri/ Many mobile devices also allow users to interact through a voice recognition interface, such as Apple’s Siri.


embedded computers/ such as automobiles may have numeric keypads and may
turn indicator lights on or off to show status, but they and their operating systems and applications are designed primarily to run without user intervention.

resource allocator/  The operating system acts as the manager of 
resources, such as CPU time, memory space, storage
space, I/O devices, and so on.

control program/  manages the execution of user programs
to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. It is especially concerned
with the operation and control of I/O devices.



Moore’s Law predicted/ that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every 18 months, and that prediction has held true.
